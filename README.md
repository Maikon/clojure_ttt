# Clojure TicTacToe
---

### Installation

To easily run the tests and play the game, I suggest installing
[Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen).

Once Leiningen is installed clone the repo:

`git clone git@github.com:Maikon/clojure_ttt.git`

To run the tests:

`lein spec`

To play the game:

`lein run`
